      `For as long as you can remember, you've heard stories about your
"crazy Uncle Simon".  He was an inventor, but your family spoke
more of how he'd disappear for long periods of time.  He'd never
say where'd he gone, so others made up the tales instead. You
never believed those stories.  At least not until he passed away
and left you his journal.`,
      `His journal was wilder than any of your family's stories.  You
uncle claimed to have discovered another world!  The way he
described it was like something out of Narnia.  He'd spent his
life exploring this world and refining the formula he'd created
to travel there.`
