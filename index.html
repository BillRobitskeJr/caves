All your life, you had heard the stories of your crazy Uncle
Simon.  He was an inventor who kept disappearing for long
periods of time, never telling anyone where he had been.

You never believed the stories, but when your uncle died and
left you his diary, you learned that they were true.  Your
uncle had discovered a magic land and a secret formula that
could take him there.  In that land was a magic ruby, and
his diary contained the instructions for going there to find
it.`);

You can go: north, south, east
You can see:
   a diary
   a small box`);

        inventory.clear();
        inventory.print(`You are holding:
   nothing
You can carry 5 more.`);
